                    <h1> AI is everywhere </h1>
                    Whether it's booking a flight, steering driverless cars, or personalizing our morning news feed, AI
                    is involved in many of our daily habits. It also participates in the decision-making of governments
                    and the private sector.

                    AI technologies are showing remarkable results in highly specialized areas such as cancer screening
                    and creating inclusive environments for people with disabilities. It can also help tackle global
                    problems such as climate change or world hunger and help reduce poverty by maximizing economic aid.

                    But this technology also brings new challenges. There is an increase in gender and ethnic biases,
                    threats to privacy, dignity and ability to act, dangers of mass surveillance and the increased use
                    of unreliable AI technologies in law enforcement, to name a few examples. Until now, there has been
                    no one-size-fits-all standard to address these issues.
                    &nbsp;
                    <h2> Content of the Recommendation</h2>
                    According to UNESCO, the recommendation aims to realize the benefits that AI brings to society and
                    to reduce the risks it entails.

                    It ensures that digital transformations promote human rights and contribute to the achievement of
                    the Sustainable Development Goals, by addressing issues related to transparency, accountability and
                    privacy.

                    It includes action-oriented policy chapters on data governance, education, culture, work, healthcare
                    and economics.
                    <h3>Data protection</h3>
                    The Recommendation calls for going beyond what tech companies and governments are doing to ensure
                    greater protection for individuals by ensuring transparency, capacity to act and control over their
                    personal data. She argues that all individuals should be able to access and even erase their
                    personal data records. It also provides for actions aimed at improving data protection and the
                    knowledge that individuals have of their own data, as well as their right to control it. It also
                    strengthens the capacity of regulators around the world to enforce these provisions.
                    <h3>Ban on social rating and mass surveillance</h3>
                    The Recommendation explicitly prohibits the use of AI systems for social scoring and mass
                    surveillance. These technologies are highly invasive, they infringe human rights and fundamental
                    freedoms, and they are used widely. The Recommendation stresses that, when developing regulatory
                    frameworks, Member States should take into account that the ultimate responsibility and
                    accountability always rests with humans and that AI technologies do not. should not themselves have
                    legal personality.
                    <h3>Support for monitoring and evaluation</h3>
                    The Recommendation also lays the foundations for the tools which will contribute to its
                    implementation. Ethical impact assessment aims to help countries and companies that develop and
                    deploy AI systems to assess the impact of those systems on individuals, society and the environment.
                    The Readiness Assessment Method helps Member States assess their readiness in terms of legal and
                    technical infrastructure. This tool will help strengthen the institutional capacity of countries and
                    recommend appropriate measures to be taken in order to ensure the practical implementation of
                    ethics. In addition,
                    <h3>Environmental Protection</h3>
                    The Recommendation emphasizes that AI actors should favor AI methods that save data, energy and
                    resources that will help make AI a major tool in the fight against climate change and the resolution
                    of environmental problems. . The Recommendation calls on governments to assess the direct and
                    indirect environmental impact throughout the lifecycle of the AI ​​system. This includes its carbon
                    footprint, energy consumption, and the environmental impact of extracting raw materials to support
                    the manufacturing of AI technologies. It also aims to reduce the environmental impact of AI systems
                    and data infrastructures. It encourages governments to invest in green technologies,
                    <h2>For fair, transparent and contestable decisions</h2>
                    Decisions that impact millions of people must be fair, transparent and contestable, said UNESCO
                    Assistant Director-General for Social and Human Sciences, Gabriela Ramos.

                    “These new technologies must help us meet the major challenges of our current world, such as
                    increasing inequalities and the environmental crisis, and not aggravate them. »Declared Ms Gabriela
                    Ramos.

                    UNESCO stresses that emerging technologies such as AI have proven their immense capacity to do good.
                    However, the Organization calls for controlling its negative effects, which exacerbate existing
                    divisions and inequalities at the global level.

                    Advances in AI must respect the rule of law, avoiding harm and ensuring that where harm occurs,
                    accountability and redress mechanisms are available to those affected, supports UNESCO.

                    <h1>Consciousness in humans, animals and artificial intelligence</h1>
                    <p> <strong> December 20, 2021 | Ruhr-University Bochum</strong>

                    </p>
                </header>

                <p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1516192518150-0d8fee5425e3?&q=80&w=1080&utm_source=unsplash_source&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit"
                        alt="image article2" id="img2">

                    Two researchers at Ruhr-Universität Bochum (RUB) have come up with a new theory of consciousness.
                    They have long been exploring the nature of consciousness, the question of how and where the brain
                    generates consciousness, and whether animals also have consciousness. The new concept describes
                    consciousness as a state that is tied to complex cognitive operations -- and not as a passive basic
                    state that automatically prevails when we are awake.

                    Professor Armin Zlomuzica from the Behavioral and Clinical Neuroscience research group at RUB and
                    Professor Ekrem Dere, formerly at Université Paris-Sorbonne, now at RUB, describe their theory in
                    the journal Behavioural Brain Research. The printed version will be published on 15 February 2022,
                    the online article has been available since November 2021.

                    "The hypotheses underlying our platform theory of consciousness can be tested in experimental
                    studies," as the authors describe one advantage of their concept over alternative models. "Thus, the
                    process of consciousness can be explored in humans and animals or even in the context of artificial
                    intelligence."
                    <h4><strong>The platform theory in detail</strong></h4>
                    The complex cognitive operations that, according to platform theory, are associated with
                    consciousness are applied to mental representations that are maintained and processed. They can
                    include perceptions, emotions, sensations, memories, imaginations and associations. Conscious
                    cognitive operations are necessary, for example, in situations where learned behaviour or habits are
                    no longer sufficient for coping. People don't necessarily need consciousness to drive a car or take
                    a shower. But when something unexpected happens, conscious cognitive actions are required to resolve
                    the situation. They are also necessary to predict future events or problems and to develop suitable
                    coping strategies. Most importantly, conscious cognitive operations are at the basis for adaptive
                    and flexible behaviour that enables humans and animals to adapt to new environmental conditions.

                    According to the new theory, conscious cognitive actions take place on the basis of a so-called
                    online platform, a kind of central executive that controls subordinate platforms. The subordinate
                    platforms can act, for example, as storage media for knowledge or activities.

                        Artificial intelligence is also advancing rapidly within the security and defense industry. When
                        AI converges with autonomy and robotics in a weapons system, we should ask ourselves, “From an
                        ethical standpoint, where should we draw the line?”
                    </div>
                    <div id="art34">Air Force pilot Col. John Boyd developed a decision-making model referred to as the
                        OODA loop — observe, orient, decide, act — to explain how to increase the tempo of decisions to
                        outpace, outmaneuver and ultimately defeat an adversary. The objective is to make decisions
                        faster than an opponent, compelling them to react to actions and enabling a force to seize the
                        initiative. But what if the adversary is a machine?

                        it now makes sense to relegate certain decisions to a machine or let the machine recommend a
                        decision to a human.</div>
