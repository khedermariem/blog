                    <h1> AI is everywhere </h1>
                    Whether it's booking a flight, steering driverless cars, or personalizing our morning news feed, AI
                    is involved in many of our daily habits. It also participates in the decision-making of governments
                    and the private sector.

                    AI technologies are showing remarkable results in highly specialized areas such as cancer screening
                    and creating inclusive environments for people with disabilities. It can also help tackle global
                    problems such as climate change or world hunger and help reduce poverty by maximizing economic aid.

                    But this technology also brings new challenges. There is an increase in gender and ethnic biases,
                    threats to privacy, dignity and ability to act, dangers of mass surveillance and the increased use
                    of unreliable AI technologies in law enforcement, to name a few examples. Until now, there has been
                    no one-size-fits-all standard to address these issues.
                    &nbsp;
                    <h2> Content of the Recommendation</h2>
                    According to UNESCO, the recommendation aims to realize the benefits that AI brings to society and
                    to reduce the risks it entails.

                    It ensures that digital transformations promote human rights and contribute to the achievement of
                    the Sustainable Development Goals, by addressing issues related to transparency, accountability and
                    privacy.

                    It includes action-oriented policy chapters on data governance, education, culture, work, healthcare
                    and economics.
                    <h3>Data protection</h3>
                    The Recommendation calls for going beyond what tech companies and governments are doing to ensure
                    greater protection for individuals by ensuring transparency, capacity to act and control over their
                    personal data. She argues that all individuals should be able to access and even erase their
                    personal data records. It also provides for actions aimed at improving data protection and the
                    knowledge that individuals have of their own data, as well as their right to control it. It also
                    strengthens the capacity of regulators around the world to enforce these provisions.
                    <h3>Ban on social rating and mass surveillance</h3>
                    The Recommendation explicitly prohibits the use of AI systems for social scoring and mass
                    surveillance. These technologies are highly invasive, they infringe human rights and fundamental
                    freedoms, and they are used widely. The Recommendation stresses that, when developing regulatory
                    frameworks, Member States should take into account that the ultimate responsibility and
                    accountability always rests with humans and that AI technologies do not. should not themselves have
                    legal personality.
                    <h3>Support for monitoring and evaluation</h3>
                    The Recommendation also lays the foundations for the tools which will contribute to its
                    implementation. Ethical impact assessment aims to help countries and companies that develop and
                    deploy AI systems to assess the impact of those systems on individuals, society and the environment.
                    The Readiness Assessment Method helps Member States assess their readiness in terms of legal and
                    technical infrastructure. This tool will help strengthen the institutional capacity of countries and
                    recommend appropriate measures to be taken in order to ensure the practical implementation of
                    ethics. In addition,
                    <h3>Environmental Protection</h3>
                    The Recommendation emphasizes that AI actors should favor AI methods that save data, energy and
                    resources that will help make AI a major tool in the fight against climate change and the resolution
                    of environmental problems. . The Recommendation calls on governments to assess the direct and
                    indirect environmental impact throughout the lifecycle of the AI ​system. This includes its carbon
                    footprint, energy consumption, and the environmental impact of extracting raw materials to support
                    the manufacturing of AI technologies. It also aims to reduce the environmental impact of AI systems
                    and data infrastructures. It encourages governments to invest in green technologies,
                    <h2>For fair, transparent and contestable decisions</h2>
                    Decisions that impact millions of people must be fair, transparent and contestable, said UNESCO
                    Assistant Director-General for Social and Human Sciences, Gabriela Ramos.

                    “These new technologies must help us meet the major challenges of our current world, such as
                    increasing inequalities and the environmental crisis, and not aggravate them. »Declared Ms Gabriela
                    Ramos.

                    UNESCO stresses that emerging technologies such as AI have proven their immense capacity to do good.
                    However, the Organization calls for controlling its negative effects, which exacerbate existing
                    divisions and inequalities at the global level.

                    Advances in AI must respect the rule of law, avoiding harm and ensuring that where harm occurs,
                    accountability and redress mechanisms are available to those affected, supports UNESCO.
