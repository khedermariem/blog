                Two researchers at Ruhr-Universität Bochum (RUB) have come up with a new theory of consciousness.
                They have long been exploring the nature of consciousness, the question of how and where the brain
                generates consciousness, and whether animals also have consciousness. The new concept describes
                consciousness as a state that is tied to complex cognitive operations -- and not as a passive basic
                state that automatically prevails when we are awake.

                Professor Armin Zlomuzica from the Behavioral and Clinical Neuroscience research group at RUB and
                Professor Ekrem Dere, formerly at Université Paris-Sorbonne, now at RUB, describe their theory in
                the journal Behavioural Brain Research. The printed version will be published on 15 February 2022,
                the online article has been available since November 2021.

                "The hypotheses underlying our platform theory of consciousness can be tested in experimental
                studies," as the authors describe one advantage of their concept over alternative models. "Thus, the
                process of consciousness can be explored in humans and animals or even in the context of artificial
                intelligence."
                <h4><strong>The platform theory in detail</strong></h4>
                The complex cognitive operations that, according to platform theory, are associated with
                consciousness are applied to mental representations that are maintained and processed. They can
                include perceptions, emotions, sensations, memories, imaginations and associations. Conscious
                cognitive operations are necessary, for example, in situations where learned behaviour or habits are
                no longer sufficient for coping. People don't necessarily need consciousness to drive a car or take
                a shower. But when something unexpected happens, conscious cognitive actions are required to resolve
                the situation. They are also necessary to predict future events or problems and to develop suitable
                coping strategies. Most importantly, conscious cognitive operations are at the basis for adaptive
                and flexible behaviour that enables humans and animals to adapt to new environmental conditions.

                According to the new theory, conscious cognitive actions take place on the basis of a so-called
                online platform, a kind of central executive that controls subordinate platforms. The subordinate
                platforms can act, for example, as storage media for knowledge or activities.
